	Data:
		- Entities (Dynamic objects that move around, player, enemies, items) 
			Flow: Physics -> Input / AI -> Collision detection (static/dynamic) -> Rendering

		- Static collision data
		- World render data
		- UI render data
		- Effects (No collision detection, can be connected to moving entities?) 

	Modules: 
		- Physics 
			Apply physics to all physics flagged entities.

		- Input 
			Update position of player entity.

		- AI 
			Update positions of hostile entities.

		- Collision Detection 
			Perform collision detection on all entities with static geometry.  Flagged?
			Perform collision detection between all moving entities. Flagged?

		- Frame Based Task Runner
			Run submitted tasks.
			Accept task submissions at any time.

		- Rendering 
			Render in order:
				all entities
				world
				effects
